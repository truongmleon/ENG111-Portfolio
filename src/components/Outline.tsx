                <p data-aos="zoom-in-up">
                I see myself becoming a better writer every year. As a sophomore, I looked back on my freshman writing and to realize I can write better now. As a junior, I looked back on the previous two years to realize I can write better now. As a senior, this is by best writing by far. So, I am pretty happy. 
                </p>
                <p data-aos="zoom-in-up">
                I took AP English Composition in hopes of becoming a better writer because, well, communication is cruical for any specialization. Computer science (my passion) in particular, requires lots of insight in explaining computer theory and efficient programming algorithms. I decided to take UW English to further develop my sense of writing because I knew I wouldn’t get that challenge from Green River College or a core Kentwood English class (and I liked working on difficult things). I walked into Mr. Lynch’s class the very same goal I walked into Mrs. Thomas’ class: bettering my writing.

                I didn’t enjoy language arts as a child. Actually, I didn’t enjoy school that much at all, but I was good at math; I somewhat liked it. In AP English Composition, I found that writing is very much like math. To construct a well-written argument, I have to logically piece reasoning and personal style to create one that is convincing. The syntax is very similar to the notation in math (I suppose syntax in programming is also worth a mention).

                Anyways, this is my portfolio.

                Here, you will see my growth as a writer with essays throughout the course. With every paper, there are four outcomes that are considered for UW Composition. My portfloio contains a reflection for each outcome; outcomes will be presented with evidence from my own writing and thoughts to illustrate my achievement. Most importantly, my growth stems from my passion to improve upon myself and the joy of writing. The most significant improvement I’ve had was writing personally. I think this was mostly thanks to learning how to write a college essay. Writing that was unnatural to previous writings and creating a personal statement has trickled down to my other writings as well. There were no more monotone pieces but rather fun, creative ones with my words and tone. The specific details that come from my own personal opinions makes this portfolio something that I am deeply proud of.
