                <p>
                I see myself becoming a better writer every year. As a sophomore, I looked back on my freshman writing and to realize I can write better now. As a junior, I looked back on the previous two years to realize I can write better now. As a senior, this is by best writing by far. So, I am pretty happy.

                I took AP English Composition in hopes of becoming a better writer because, well, communication is crucial for any specialization. Computer science (my passion) in particular, requires lots of insight in explaining computer theory and efficient programming algorithms. I decided to take UW Literature to further develop my sense of writing because I knew I wouldn’t get that challenge from Green River College or a core Kentwood English class (and I liked working on difficult things). After taking UW Composition, I was pretty excited to take a literature class. I enjoyed ENG111 more than ENG131 because it was something different compared to AP English Composition. Reading <i>Fahrenheit 451</i> opened new perspectives that I really enjoyed.

                I didn’t enjoy reading as a child. I really only enjoyed silly novels such as <i>Big Nate</i>, <i>Dairy of a Wimpy Kid</i>, and <i>Captain Underpants</i>. Actually, I didn’t enjoy school that much at all, but I was good at math; I somewhat liked it. In AP English Composition, I found that writing is very much like math. To construct a well-written argument, I have to logically piece reasoning and personal style to create one that is convincing. The syntax is very similar to the notation in math (I suppose syntax in programming is also worth a mention). Literature adds a fruitful aspect, which is a story. Like I could write well in composition, but I feel like taking this literature class has made my writing a bit less boring.

                Anyways, this is my portfolio.
                </p>
                <p>
                Here, you will see my growth as a writer with essays throughout the course. My portfolio contains a reflection for Outcome Three and Outcome Four; outcomes will be presented with evidence from my own writing and thoughts to illustrate my achievement. Most importantly, my growth stems from my passion to improve upon myself and the joy of writing. Despite being kind of tired and eager for the school year to end, I pushed through to make sure I make a thoughtful portfolio. The specific details that come from my own personal opinions makes this portfolio something that I am deeply proud of.
