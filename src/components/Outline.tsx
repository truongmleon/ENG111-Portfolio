                    People care too much. 
                    People care too much about their surroundings. 
                    People care too much about other people. 
                    People care too much about what other people think of them.

                How can people <i>choose</i> what they care about without sacrificing time and resources?
                    It's not as simple as sorting apples and oranges.
                    People tend to notice that when they donâ€™t care, everything seems to work out in place. The pieces of the puzzle suddenly fit together without many measures.

                When I was in algebra, I was always trying to aim for that 100%. In the last test, I stopped caring about getting a perfect score; it just so happened that was the only math test I got a 100% that year. Some could argue it was a mere coincidence, but I felt significantly more at ease that day when I took it.

                <p data-aos="zoom-in-up">We all know it. You know it. Perhaps you're scared of it. Most people in their lives have experienced social anxiety. Well, I know I did, at least. But really, only a small margin of people care about who you are and what you do, which could be your tightest friends or your amplest judgers. It took me a long time to realize this, and realizing was all it took to move another step in the life puzzle. That step was an opportunity to feel more confident and happier.
