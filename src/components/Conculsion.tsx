                    So this is the end of my first course in English this year. I only have one more English class in a high school setting before I move on. While I may not take many English classes at university, I realize that my writing is decent from the courses I’ve taken in high school.

                    Despite writing last minute and getting buried from Green River work, I made sure I enjoyed the process of writing and write using my inner voice. Despite the course occurring for just a semester, it felt like my writing progressed for over a year.

                    I hope to see this similar outcome in ENG111. Who knows if I’ll enjoy a literature class. I do enjoy reading manga, though. And it should be a fun class if I ever want to study game development.

                    On the technical side, I’ve noticed that many people in the STEM field fail to communicate effectively; I’m going to make sure to use what I learned in this class to argue efficiently for why my physics approach works or why my code has a better time complexity.

                    I didn’t think I would succeed this well. I’d say the passion for learning is the biggest contributor, from learning how to code to now. For some reason, I was never really taught that writing was supposed to be flexible. I think it’s crazy how it took 12 years of formal education for that realization.

                    I only got a few more months with Mr. Harp and Mr. Lynch. Excited to see what comes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvFZjo5PgG0&pp=ygURcmljayByb2xsIG5vdCBhZHM%3D" target="_blank" id="rick">next</a>.
