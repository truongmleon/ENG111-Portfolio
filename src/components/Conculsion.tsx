                    So this is the end of my second-to-last course in English in forever. During the summer, I will take a technical writing class at Green River. While I will no longer take any English classes as I’m at UW, I realize that my writing is decent from the courses I’ve taken.

                    Despite writing last minute and getting buried from Green River work, I made sure I enjoyed the process of writing and write using my inner voice. Despite the course occurring for just a semester, it felt like my writing progressed for over two years from ENG131 and ENG111.

                    On the technical side, I’ve noticed that many people in the STEM field fail to communicate effectively; I’m going to make sure to use what I learned in this class to argue efficiently and think creatively for why my physics approach works or why my code has a better time complexity or space complexity.

                    I didn’t think I would succeed this well and better than the last course. I’d say the passion for learning is the biggest contributor, from learning how to code to now. I learned that writing was flexible in ENG131, and now I learned how to make my writing “more fun” in ENG111.

                    It’s crazy how I only have one more English class left. The end is already here. For some people, math ends earlier than English. Something tells me that I’ll recognize how math is just like English when I construct proofs at UW.
