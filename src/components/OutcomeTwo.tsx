                In my Major Paper, I mentioned texts from the internet, being watched, genres, and identity. Textual evidence is accompanied by my analysis and a personal story. A significant portion of my essay talks about the internet being a tool for multiple identities. Before I got there, I made sure to talk about a basis for utilizing technology, such as trying to document oneself with text from Maybe Baby by Haley Nahman. Now with a basis for learning a little bit of that implicit identity, I led in the reader with a personal example of me trying to complete my English project and then I followed with the concept of acting and patterns with the piece Genres: Shapes of Meaning by Catherine McDonald: acting is what makes up an identity. Once I set the reader up for thinking about acting and documentation, I offered an idea for the Hawthorne effect to be minimized so they can learn as much as possible from mere documentation. This gives an idea that multiple identities can be made from just a camera alone. My essay doesn’t necessarily follow any sort of set structure; the flow of the texts one by one naturally follow one another with the key concepts of the internet and identity.

                With every source I read, I thought about how I could pirate off it and develop insight using my personal thought as well. When Nahman talked about people using TikTok to create an identity different from themselves, it reminded me of using memes and filters to adjust our lives to make it more fun. While these are only temporary, these small additions make life more fruitful. Furthermore, I also realized that too much of using memes and filters can be distracting and addicting. While we have differing levels for what makes technology distracting, it’s a nice thought bubble to continue questioning.

                I talked about the flaws of the internet and how it can slow us down from wanting to explore and develop multiple identities with the piece The ‘I’ in the Internet by Jia Tolentino. The example of Nigel illustrates the amplified hate because of the internet. To lessen this kind of disturbance, my essay talked about talking breaks from social media, but to those looking to obtain a bunch of perspectives, this might be your thing.

                <p data-aos="zoom-out-up" className="subtlety-text">
                Something that didn’t really stand out to me in my previous Englishes was that textual evidence can “talk” to each other. Here in my Major Paper, I dropped the linearity of having two pieces of evidence to support a claim. Nahman’s and McDonald’s pieces ties closely with the idea of being watched. I took advantage of how genres are similar to habits of acting in specific environments. Utilizing this connection, I talked about personal examples regarding my close friends’ Discord server and an academic one.
