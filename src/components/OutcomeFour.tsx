                        My first couple drafts of my college essay involved using ‘we’ to refer to myself and future self. I wanted to add that detail to signify the growth of me, but I’m clearly not a writer who can use that idea effectively, so I had to (re)brainstorm to make my essay less confusing to the reader using the confusion I noticed from my friends. Instead of trying to set up my essay like a video game to try to be different from other college applicants, I (re)drafted my essay to be personal rather than crafting a unique essay. As I went through my essay, I (re)read parts I just edited to make sure the story flows well and to add or (re)write specific details of my story, such as the coding projects only I could have made instead of trying to sound fancy with super cool projects. Many hours were spent re(thinking) if I added enough of my personal details to communicate effectively about my passion with coding with my reader, editing unnecessary details of my story.

                        Feedback is crucial for developing an effective college essay as writing one is typically different from what is written in any humanities class. A college essay is a specific piece of writing that tries to convince the admissions officers to not throw you in the reject pile. Naturally, college applicants strive to make their essay unique using fancy language, advanced rhetorical choices, and adding imaginative details to “show not tell.”

                        <br />
                        Giving feedback appears like busywork, but it’s quite useful to have a look at what ideas people incorporate into different contexts. Helping revise other people’s writing is like writing another college essay in a different perspective. When friends asked me to read their essay, I was quite happy to help knowing I would read interesting stories and helping them polish their essay like it was my own.

                        I read a piece titled <i>HACK THE COLLEGE ESSAY</i> by John Dewis, which gave advice on how make a good personal statement. While I did not receive direct feedback from Dewis, his guide was the best implicit feedback I’ve had for my college essay. My initial story felt interesting, where I introduced my reader to my enjoyment of gaming and how the steps were taken to craft my passion of coding. Was it personal? No, not really. It wasn’t an “essay no one else could write,” which was interpreted as I needed to be myself (7). I learned in AP English Composition last year that my writing needs to sound like me. I’ve forgotten about early in my senior year as I was too focused on making the MOST-UNIQUE-GEEKY-ESSAY. I read through the essay I submitted to Mr. Lynch, but it didn’t sound like me at all. 
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The voices to be unique in a college essay is distributing. In Chapter 6, Dewis talked about not being “deep.” I tried so hard to be unique that I wasted the precious 650-word count with weird gaming formatting and unnecessary long descriptions that could have been told simply. At this point of my revision, I got rid of the video game format entirely and just focused on incorporating a story that I experienced myself. For now, it would just be simple storytelling for my new essay.

                        I went through Dewis’ guide to add revisions after each chapter. I told a story, but it didn’t feel complete. It didn’t feel complete until Chapter 12, where the goal was to include every piece of the story – even the bad and uncomfortable. I told myself that this was terrible advice and that I didn’t want the admission officers to learn about my embarrassing start to coding. Then it hit me; this is exactly what admission officers are looking for: an uncomfortable fact that agrees with my situation. It took me so long to realize that I need to tell my story with both good and the ugly. In many countless revisions, I finally wrote the true reason why I started coding in the first place.
