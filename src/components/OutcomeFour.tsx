Outcome Four is about going through different versions of writing and choosing what works and what doesn’t, using possible feedback from peers. I will use the Major Paper One, Sudden Fiction, and the feedback I gave for another student’s Sudden Fiction for this reflection.</h4>

                        For the Sudden Fiction assignment, I struggled with coming up with a plot I was happy with. There were ideas I liked from reading various manga, but I was not a creative writer. I revised often during certain points of the plot such as when a character died or when the story progressed to the war. I started the story with many extra spaces between text (like one-sentence paragraphs), but it became kind of strange because it’s like time elapsed per line break, so I stuck with making full body paragraphs per time skip. Creating fulfilled paragraphs instead of similar, many paragraphs possibly made it less confusing to read as well because of its fluidity.

                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The biggest obstacle for me was character writing. I knew that authors spent a lot of time studying to create a character. I had to think back on what sort of characters I liked. During the time of writing, I was reading the manga <i>JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</i> and I really liked how the characters joined along Jojo’s journey, and how it felt emotionally empowering in their deaths. I wanted to create a relationship between the characters and the reader because I wanted the characters to die at some point so the readers could feel sentimental about it. I first started to gather four characters at a picnic, but it felt way too fast. I wasn’t able to develop them at all even though I started with how they met in childhood. Doing all four at once wasn’t enough. I later decided to just have three characters so it would be more in-depth. I talk about the relationship between the main character separately rather than having a friend group. That worked out pretty well and the characters developed a little more. The reader was able to feel more emotions this way.

                        Feedback is so important to improve in everything. It helps open perspectives and provides ideas on what to fix. I realized that my focus on the Major Paper was quite narrow. Mr. Lynch talked about whether there was more scope in reading <i>Fahrenheit 451</i>. The biggest and most obvious idea I came up with was how it’s an issue that books are banned. Therefore, after some reflecting on the whole piece, I broadened the argument further to show that yes, there are plenty of applications for <i>Fahrenheit 451</i>! This revision will give the audience more to look forward to in the essay and set up a motivation as to why even read the book. For me, I find that having a good reason to read or watch something helps me be engaged with the text.

                        <br />
                        <i>“Furthermore, it also has value in thinking critically as it creates an interesting moral issue to pause and ponder. While we may hear debates about literature from time to time, it’s nice to have Fahrenheit 451 in the back of your mind when comparing different arguments whether it’s about book censorship or a general argument for censoring the workplace and communities” (1).</i>

                        I was also happy to give feedback. I was often critical of other people’s writings for the sake of helping them succeed in the papers. While I was peer reviewing a student’s SA6, I noticed an interesting narration that I thought it should be addressed. I believe my comments were helpful.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <i>“When the author used ‘I’ in narration, it threw me off a little, ‘He had hoped that this time she told the truth, I mean if they went shopping there’s no way she would be lying’ (2). The narration was good as they were telling a story, but then personal thought was added with the ‘I’. I think it would be better if the narration was consistent” (1).</i>

                        My genre for Sudden Fiction is sort of a mystery genre. At first, I wasn’t sure what type of style I wanted my story to be. I later reviewed ideas from <i>Land of the Lustrous</i> how it too, had a mysterious feeling about the unknowns. So I decided to give an unknown feeling as well because I wanted an immortality aspect, which is pretty interesting to think about. There was also some slight foreshadowing because I really enjoyed it when I reread stuff. It’s difficult to give some foreshadowing without spoiling a moderate amount of the story, but I go through it after multiple revisions.

                       <br />
                       I initially wanted to have a clear conclusion on what happened, but I think it’s more interesting for the reader to infer themselves. I’d say this aspect makes the story more thought-provoking rather than making it explicit. I always enjoyed thinking about how to interpret the endings, even if it’s confusing.
