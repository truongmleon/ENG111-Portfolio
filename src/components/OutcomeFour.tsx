                        Manson often helps the audience self-reflect with some reasoning. This allows the audience to develop an intuition the next time they face a similar problem. It ties in with how throughout the book Manson describes situations with aphorisms.
                        An example of this is when Manson was discussing improvement requiring numerous failures to succeed. The next time the audience thinks “they are better than me,” they reflect and think it’s because they put in the effort, so they should too.
