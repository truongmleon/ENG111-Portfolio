                    Manson started a blog in 2007 to post about dating advice; fast-forward to 2010, he transitioned to self-help writing. The internet really started to gain traction around this time among younger generations, especially with the debut of the iPhone. Now, there was a place where one could efficiently find endless amounts of information in a matter of seconds. A quick search like "How do I get my EX back?"" would pop-up hundreds of results. As Manson was developing life advice with humor and such unique word choice on his blog, he started gaining a following as a million people read his blogs every month. It’s owed to the internet that Manson was able to provide self-help advice from his experiences, which led to the growth of his audience. Manson basically went from being a broke college student to making crappy blogs to becoming a self-help influencer. <i>In the book The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck</i>, he tells numerous stories across various timelines to try to get the audience to understand what is being depicted. The stories told are meaningful and help the audience relate with a sense of humor.
                    The connections made between the audience and the book help people choose what is important on their plate.

                    Manson viewed the self-help industry poorly and as not very helpful to society. The culture of mindless positivity just wasn’t practical. His book is a response to that – to help people choose what is significant in life. He wants to give a healthier perspective on pain, trauma, and difficulties. People struggle; he wants people to struggle better. The people who desire self-help think something is wrong with themselves. Or perhaps someone who is already good wants to eliminate gaps to become a better person. The person who thinks something is wrong with them lacks self-acceptance and will think every choice they have made is flawed.
