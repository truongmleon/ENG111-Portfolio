                In my autobiography, I wanted to talk about my ideas psychologically with respect to social life. I talked about how the internet impacted Englishes in different contexts by recreating perspectives with my closest friends and the general web. I also understood and accounted consequences for my language (for slur usage) and arguments to make it personal (it is an autobiography, after all).

                I incorporated my own understanding of conformity and individually by providing specific examples of a friend’s philosophical discussion and a school project. Along with dialogue and descriptions, I reflected on the events to add my present perspective and thought. As teenagers often feel the need to get along with others, I responded by suggesting that trying to fit in and following trends you don’t like wastes time from learning in life as learning is truly amplified from not caring, especially in an internet-driven world. I considered that some people may struggle to make friends and wish to put forth effort into caring about creating friendships the most.

                Throughout Manson’s book, he utilizes a large magnitude of aphorisms. After all, this is a self-improvement book designed for improving one’s life. An example is when Manson talked about how people felt “right” doing terrible things. Most people likely don’t realize or understand the “why” people do what they do. This says quite a lot about the perspectives of others and on the flip side, what other people might think about them since it's helpful to get an idea of every perspective.

                    about their genetic superiority."</i>

                The language Manson portrays is not formal and is easily understood by most people. Writing comprehension allows for a boarder audience as many people have difficulties choosing what problem is beneficial for their improvement. His writing is fluid and creative to prevent boredom within the audience with a lower possibility of misunderstanding the text. Creativity allows people to feel more upbeat - it feels more personal like talking to a close friend.
