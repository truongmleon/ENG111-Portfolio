            <h3  className="analysis-header">In an effective argument, it is crucial to develop and present different perspectives. Outcome Three is about considering perspectives and arguing for perspectives, using perspectives. I will use both Major Paper One and Sudden Fiction for this reflection.</h3>

                <p  className="content-text">
                Having many types of perspectives will strengthen an argument because there are more ideas to choose to consider. With how the book is written, the first thing that comes to mind is book censorship. I incorporated Katherine Kapustka’s idea of how book banning hinders critical thinking skills. While the idea of book censorship was significant in the book, I also noticed how from a different point of view, it could be applied elsewhere such as the workplace and other communities in which there’s unreasonable censorship.
                <br />
                <br />
                <i>“Furthermore, it also has value in thinking critically as it creates an interesting moral issue to pause and ponder. While we may hear debates about literature from time to time, it’s nice to have Fahrenheit 451 in the back of your mind when comparing different arguments whether it’s about book censorship or a general argument for censoring the workplace and communities (1)”.</i>
                <br />
                <br />
                I wanted to speak my voice as myself and someone who felt that they needed to argue for <i>Fahrenheit 451</i>. Experimenting with my writing is what will make that voice come out. With some personal insight and examples, I was sure to keep the audience engaged in learning a bit about who the author of the Major Paper was. This adds at least some creditability for me and that I’m not a robot. First, I remarked on a realization that people should be aware of. Sure, we may not remember what happened much in the book, but the experience is fulfilling. This line of reasoning strengthens my argument why people should read <i>Fahrenheit 451</i>.
                <br />
                <br />
                <i>“It’s similar to how after finishing Fahrenheit 451 (or other books for that matter), we throw it away, but it sticks with us. This highlights an idea I never considered” (3).</i>
                <br />
                <br />
                Another personal insight is an anecdote from my time as a tutor. As Ray Bradbury, the author of <i>Fahrenheit 451</i> warned about how the internet was promoting illiteracy, I brought up how COVID-19 also had an impact on that. This basically sort of doubles down on illiteracy and I wanted to talk about the first-hand experience of that. The media is a factor that makes children both more and less educated at the same time. This interesting remark will further convince people to gain the <i>Fahrenheit 451</i> perspective to see Bradbury’s point of view.
                <br />
                <br />
                “I tutored a few 6th graders a few months ago and many of them did not know how to multiply or divide – which was pretty standard to know in 4th grade in the KSD. It continues to stay relevant with any type of conflict whether it’s simply about conducting experiments like Steve Jobs or creating arguments for the Israeli–Palestinian conflict” (4).

                All sources should be closely analyzed for creating and effective argument. In Major Paper One, I recognized rhetorical choices such as irony and foreshadowing that were important for my argument of convincing why Bradbury was an excellent writer. These were significant factors because they highlight an interesting, thought-provoking reality. This different reality led me to choose texts about book banning and free-thinking. Being able to read a text again and discover new things or find ideas that were hinted at is one of my reasons for liking a piece of literature. In this example, I really wanted the reader to understand just how unique the foreshadowing is when it was strange when Clarisse McClellan collected butterflies.
                <br />
                <br />
                “In a conversation with Montag and McClellan, she noted how a psychiatrist wanted to know why she would ‘go out and hike around in the forests and watch the birds and collect butterflies’ (20). This is a strange thing to think about because those are typical things that we might enjoy doing” (6).

                In a particular part of my autobiography, I talked about some side effects of social media. Something that's used for playful communication can for creating disturbances. There’s a lot to say about what is right and wrong for the vocabulary and the actions we use. I understood the consequence of the internet being more of a threat than a tool by talking about my friend group’s communist English and Chink English. I realize that when I use language that appears wrong, you may be judged or generalized. And I’m fine with that; the joy I have with my friends outweighs that to a large magnitude. The autobiography simply feels more personal when I talk about issues I’ve faced as well as relatable to some audiences. I accounted the stakes of my autobiography by creating a crucial realization about our current lives. It’s obvious our lives are different compared to a century ago, but something I feel like people (mostly young people like Generation Z) fail to notice is just how integrated and beautiful technology is.

                        When I was wrapping up my paper, it was a truly nice feeling knowing how fun my life is (mostly due to mobile devices). To a lot of people (and my desired audience), new devices and gimmicks feel “normal,” and they don’t stop to think about how much their phone has helped them to feel “normal” carrying it around. In my autobiography, I mentioned acronyms and abbreviations for text messaging. In non-formal contexts, it’s extremely efficient to use those terms. Likewise, and I haven’t mentioned this in my autobiography (I mention it very briefly in my Major Paper), but the concept of artificial intelligence (AI) suddenly feels “normal” after a few months. It’s natural for technology to go like that, but it would be interesting if acronym users and daily AI users stop to think about just how cool the idea is and how much it helped them. My purpose is to argue for a striking realization with personal examples throughout my life.
