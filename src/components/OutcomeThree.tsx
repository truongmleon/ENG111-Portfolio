                Anecdotes. They help make the text more appealing and interesting to read. Manson proves numerous anecdotes to put the audience into perspective. The way the exemplification is provided feels sophisticated and insightful, so the audience can take away crucial information efficiently.
                He sets the stage by talking about Charles Bukowski, an alcoholic, a chronic gambler, a lout, and a poet. Bukowski wanted to be a writer, but his work was rejected by every journal and newspaper. It was said his work was terrible. Horrid. Boorish. Disgusting. Drinking alcohol was his way of coping after rejection after rejection. An editor showed curiosity to Bukowski and gave him a chance to publish his first novel, <i>Post Office</i>. He went on and published hundreds of poems and six novels. Bukowski didn't care about his success. He was still drinking after drinking, gambling away. Bukowski knew he was a loser and wholeheartedly accepted it as he didn’t try to change because he didn't care.

                <i>"He never tried to be anything other than what he was. The genius in
                    Bukowski’s work was not in overcoming unbelievable odds or developing
                    himself into a shining literary light. It was the opposite. It was his simple
                    ability to be completely, unflinchingly honest with himself—especially the
                    worst parts of himself—and to share his failings without hesitation or doubt."</i>

                Throughout Manson’s book, he utilizes a large magnitude of aphorisms. After all, this is a self-improvement book designed for improving one’s life. An example is when Manson talked about how people felt “right” doing terrible things. Most people likely don’t realize or understand the “why” people do what they do. This says quite a lot about the perspectives of others and on the flip side, what other people might think about them since it's helpful to get an idea of every perspective.

                    they must feel an unwavering certainty in their own righteousness, in their
                    own beliefs and deservedness. Racists do racist things because they’re certain
                    about their genetic superiority."</i>

                The language Manson portrays is not formal and is easily understood by most people. Writing comprehension allows for a boarder audience as many people have difficulties choosing what problem is beneficial for their improvement. His writing is fluid and creative to prevent boredom within the audience with a lower possibility of misunderstanding the text. Creativity allows people to feel more upbeat - it feels more personal like talking to a close friend.
