                In my autobiography, I wanted to talk about my ideas psychologically with respect to social life. I talked about how the internet impacted Englishes in different contexts by recreating perspectives with my closest friends and the general web. I also understood and accounted consequences for my language (for slur usage) and arguments to make it personal (it is an autobiography, after all).

                I incorporated my own understanding of conformity and individually by providing specific examples of a friend’s philosophical discussion and a school project. Along with dialogue and descriptions, I reflected on the events to add my present perspective and thought. As teenagers often feel the need to get along with others, I responded by suggesting that trying to fit in and following trends you don’t like wastes time from learning in life as learning is truly amplified from not caring, especially in an internet-driven world. I considered that some people may struggle to make friends and wish to put forth effort into caring about creating friendships the most.

                The idea that it all comes down to the modern-day internet didn’t really occur to me until I finished my body paragraphs of my autobiography. Well, of course growing up in 21st century would mean that my life would be supported by technology. As I grew up playing games and texting friends through an iPad, it felt natural to me; I didn’t really think about until I reached crafting a conclusion. I reflected on each my claims and noticed that my examples would be more difficult to occur. For instance, I question or assume that working in group projects without Discord or email would be hard unless you live very close to your groupmate’s house. And also, the amazing jokes about being a communist would happen less often. The talk of virtual learning, efficient one-to-one communication, and the idea that information can be widespread is evidence for how technology changed our behaviors and habits. I wake up checking Discord to talk with friends and popping up Canvas to see what I have to do for the day.

                In a particular part of my autobiography, I talked about some side effects of social media. Something that's used for playful communication can for creating disturbances. There’s a lot to say about what is right and wrong for the vocabulary and the actions we use. I understood the consequence of the internet being more of a threat than a tool by talking about my friend group’s communist English and Chink English. I realize that when I use language that appears wrong, you may be judged or generalized. And I’m fine with that; the joy I have with my friends outweighs that to a large magnitude. The autobiography simply feels more personal when I talk about issues I’ve faced as well as relatable to some audiences. I accounted the stakes of my autobiography by creating a crucial realization about our current lives. It’s obvious our lives are different compared to a century ago, but something I feel like people (mostly young people like Generation Z) fail to notice is just how integrated and beautiful technology is.

                        When I was wrapping up my paper, it was a truly nice feeling knowing how fun my life is (mostly due to mobile devices). To a lot of people (and my desired audience), new devices and gimmicks feel “normal,” and they don’t stop to think about how much their phone has helped them to feel “normal” carrying it around. In my autobiography, I mentioned acronyms and abbreviations for text messaging. In non-formal contexts, it’s extremely efficient to use those terms. Likewise, and I haven’t mentioned this in my autobiography (I mention it very briefly in my Major Paper), but the concept of artificial intelligence (AI) suddenly feels “normal” after a few months. It’s natural for technology to go like that, but it would be interesting if acronym users and daily AI users stop to think about just how cool the idea is and how much it helped them. My purpose is to argue for a striking realization with personal examples throughout my life.
