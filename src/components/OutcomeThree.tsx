Outcome Three is about considering perspectives and arguing for perspectives, using perspectives. I will use both Major Paper One and Sudden Fiction for this reflection.</h3>

                Having many types of perspectives will strengthen an argument because there are more ideas to choose to consider. With how the book is written, the first thing that comes to mind is book censorship. I incorporated Katherine Kapustka’s idea of how book banning hinders critical thinking skills. While the idea of book censorship was significant in the book, I also noticed how from a different point of view, it could be applied elsewhere such as the workplace and other communities in which there’s unreasonable censorship.
                <br />
                <br />
                <i>“Furthermore, it also has value in thinking critically as it creates an interesting moral issue to pause and ponder. While we may hear debates about literature from time to time, it’s nice to have Fahrenheit 451 in the back of your mind when comparing different arguments whether it’s about book censorship or a general argument for censoring the workplace and communities (1)”.</i>
                <br />
                <br />
                I wanted to speak my voice as myself and someone who felt that they needed to argue for <i>Fahrenheit 451</i>. Experimenting with my writing is what will make that voice come out. With some personal insight and examples, I was sure to keep the audience engaged in learning a bit about who the author of the Major Paper was. This adds at least some creditability for me and that I’m not a robot. First, I remarked on a realization that people should be aware of. Sure, we may not remember what happened much in the book, but the experience is fulfilling. This line of reasoning strengthens my argument why people should read <i>Fahrenheit 451</i>.
                <br />
                <br />
                <i>“It’s similar to how after finishing Fahrenheit 451 (or other books for that matter), we throw it away, but it sticks with us. This highlights an idea I never considered” (3).</i>
                <br />
                <br />
                Another personal insight is an anecdote from my time as a tutor. As Ray Bradbury, the author of <i>Fahrenheit 451</i> warned about how the internet was promoting illiteracy, I brought up how COVID-19 also had an impact on that. This basically sort of doubles down on illiteracy and I wanted to talk about the first-hand experience of that. The media is a factor that makes children both more and less educated at the same time. This interesting remark will further convince people to gain the <i>Fahrenheit 451</i> perspective to see Bradbury’s point of view.
                <br />
                <br />
                <i>“I tutored a few 6th graders a few months ago and many of them did not know how to multiply or divide – which was pretty standard to know in 4th grade in the KSD. It continues to stay relevant with any type of conflict whether it’s simply about conducting experiments like Steve Jobs or creating arguments for the Israeli–Palestinian conflict” (4).</i>

                All sources should be closely analyzed for creating and effective argument. In Major Paper One, I recognized rhetorical choices such as irony and foreshadowing that were important for my argument of convincing why Bradbury was an excellent writer. These were significant factors because they highlight an interesting, thought-provoking reality. This different reality led me to choose texts about book banning and free-thinking. Being able to read a text again and discover new things or find ideas that were hinted at is one of my reasons for liking a piece of literature. In this example, I really wanted the reader to understand just how unique the foreshadowing is when it was strange when Clarisse McClellan collected butterflies.
                <br />
                <br />
                <i>“In a conversation with Montag and McClellan, she noted how a psychiatrist wanted to know why she would ‘go out and hike around in the forests and watch the birds and collect butterflies’ (20). This is a strange thing to think about because those are typical things that we might enjoy doing” (6). </i>
                <br />
                <br />
                With this realization, I went forth to realize that Bradbury was quite a critical thinker. His ideas are connected at multiple points in the book. You could tell that Bradbury planned a lot into this, which makes this a wonderful read again and again. Picking out perspectives in the book has given me lots of evidence to work with in my argument.
                <br />
                <br />
                <i>“He later uses a simile when Captain Beatty tries to lecture Montag on burning books when how you ‘Light the first page, light the second page. Each becomes a black butterfly’ (72). Now it makes a little more sense. The psychiatrist was possibly concerned about how McClellan was collecting pages in the book, which is a little bit strange if people considered that butterflies are pages. […] It’s really fun to play with these ideas and it continues to show how readers can learn from Bradbury’s unique writing perspective” (6).</i>

                As this a literature class, there’s much to consider about what makes literature a hard read. In Major Paper One, I discussed some of the reasons why the <i>Fahrenheit 451</i> is transgressive. Discussing these counterarguments is important to address. The transgressive nature of the book is why there’s just more reason to read the book, so I outlined some common ideas here.
                <br />
                <br />
                <i>“There were three key ideas that makes this book transgressive: firefighters killing other firefighters, books being illegal, and new perspectives are banished” (1).</i>
                <br />
                <br />
                In the later part of the major paper, a significant idea I dove deeper into was the portrayal of women. Arguing why this concept was an integral part of the book strengthens my argument to show that this taboo is important. It’s reasoned that it shouldn’t be the reason why someone would stray away from the book.
                <br />
                <br />
                <i>“I feel like the idea of having men be superior to women has historical and dystopian aspects to it. […] The gender roles show how blind people can be if we were to limit our perspectives, and Bradbury honestly couldn’t have done it better” (7).</i>

                        As I believe I have a playful personality, I wanted my papers to sound like me if I were talking to my HOMIES. Aside from gathering textual evidence and bringing in personal examples and opinions, I wanted to discuss specifics outside of my life to argue using psychological/philosophical thought and personal readings. In the Sudden Fiction assignment, I referenced an excellent manga named <i>Land of the Lustrous</i> to show my interest in reading manga. I finished reading it and shortly after, the assignment was announced. The manga had ideas of immortality and it was pretty interesting to think about the concept, so I wrote my story on that.

                        There were also talks about math and chess club to sprinkle some of my hobbies. And as someone who loves learning, I created a small history simulation. My interests sparked my personality in my works. While it’s difficult to write characters, thinking about myself to create characters helps create more depth in my story.
